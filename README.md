# Jumper
Tension so thick you can cut it with a knife! <i>Jumper</i> seems like a pretty 
laid back game until it's not! The rules are simple. The jumper guesses letters, 
one at a time. If the letter's not in the puzzle, the parachute loses a line. 
Guessing continues until the puzzle is solved or, well, you know.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. 
Open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by 
running the following command.
```
python3 jumper 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE 
and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and 
click the "run" icon.
